// the problem with this QuranHighlights thing is that I need to show here actual verses means I'll need to do the 
// same process I did back then with showing the verses in the authmani scripting here too 
// and not to forget ofc the OnClick go to verse~ logic 

// probably scripting the verses here as keys would help but Idk means I'll need to fetch each time which is ass

//since you can only highlight verses I would save the verse keys and then show them OFC WITH FETCHING cause I don't think kayen another way 
// getting the page number is part of the process so I can font the data

export default function QuranHighlights() {
    return(
        <div className="text-white">
            
        </div>
    )    
}
